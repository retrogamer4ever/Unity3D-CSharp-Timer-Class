Using the class is very easyâ€¦ 

In your Unity3D C# script simply create an instance of the timer in the "Start()" function, passing in how many seconds you want the timer to fire on. Then you can set a 
delegate to the timers tick event, this will be fired based on the amount of seconds you passed in the timer constructor.

public Timer timer;

Timer = new Timer( 1000 );
timer.tick += delegate( System.Object o, System.EventArgs e ) { print( "it ticked" ); };


Then in the Update() function you will need to make sure to keep calling the timers update.

timer.Update();


Thats it! You are now using a timer very similar to the one in Action Script 3.0.
